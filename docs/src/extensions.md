# Extensions

There are a few extensions available for this project:

Creating a digital twin in Python; a computer simulated version of your
accelerator. This will allow you to quickly prototype different architecture
designs. Improving speed and logic resource utilization, are there any
optimizations you can make to your design? Using HLS on a more advanced FPGA.
Higher Level Synthesis allow you to program your FPGA in special higher level
language, which can speed up design cycles at the cost of losing control over
how the design is synthesized.
