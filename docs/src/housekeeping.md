# Housekeeping

## Work area

All teaching work will take place on a shared server, which students can access
at any time. This shared server will host all the tools required to complete the
course, including:

- cocotb for Python-based RTL verification
- Icarus Verilog simulator
- Verilator simulator
- yosys for synthesis
- Gowin (FPGA vendor) tools

## Editor

We will use the VSCode Editor with the Remote SSH plugin to work on files hosted
on the shared server.

## Course structure

There are 12 contact hours allocated to this project. To meet
[CREST Gold](https://www.crestawards.org/help-centre/gold-criteria-guidance/)
guidelines, students are expected to make up 58 hours of independent work.

Material has been appropriately portioned into 12 sessions but note that the
last few sessions will place emphasis on building and problem solving. In broad
strokes, we will learn about:

- training neural networks with PyTorch
- digital design basics
- FPGAs
- machine learning computations

## Schedule

We will meet once every weekend, with occasional breaks given for longer term
work. Your supervisor will let you know in advance when this happens.

There will be homework set on an ad-hoc basis.

## This website

This website is meant to be a digital companion for the course, it is not a
replacement. It is highly unlikely you will be able to complete the course
relying solely on this website if you are a beginner to digital design.

My explanations are not comprehensive, you should always refer to a textbook for
a full description of the topic. The information I give you is motivated by:

1. Helping you get to those "aha!" moments
2. Filling in the intuition gaps that textbooks miss
3. Relevance to our course and what we're trying to build

I've organized the topics and information on each page in accordance with the
above guidelines. The goal is that each heading topic motivates the next, in a
cascade effect.

A glossary of terms is included at the end of each session to help you in report
writing and to avoid any use of imprecise language.
