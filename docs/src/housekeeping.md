# Housekeeping

## Work area

All teaching work will take place on a shared server, which students can access
at any time. This shared server will host all the tools required to complete the
course, including:

- cocotb for Python-based RTL verification
- Icarus Verilog simulator
- Verilator simulator
- yosys for synthesis
- Gowin (FPGA vendor) tools

## Editor

We will use the VSCode Editor with the Remote SSH plugin to work on files hosted
on the shared server.

## Course structure

There are 12 contact hours allocated to this project. To meet
[CREST Gold](https://www.crestawards.org/help-centre/gold-criteria-guidance/)
guidelines, students are expected to make up 58 hours of independent work.

Material has been appropriately portioned into 12 sessions but note that the
last few sessions will place emphasis on building and problem solving. In broad
strokes, we will learn about:

- training neural networks with PyTorch
- digital design basics
- FPGAs
- machine learning computations

## Schedule

We will meet once every weekend, with occasional breaks given for longer term
work. Your supervisor will let you know in advance when this happens.

There will be homework set on an ad-hoc basis.

## Teaching style

While I try and approach all topics from the most intuitive and
'first-principles' perspective, it's possible it might not work for you. I
therefore highly encourage the practice of asking questions all throughout the
course as well as for you to supplement the course material with some of the
resources linked on this site. Remember, this course is not self-contained, it's
merely an introduction to the weird and wonderful world(s) of digital design and
machine learning. I encourage you to go _off-piste_!

A few more tips:

- **Do your homework!** I've deliberately crafted homework to be direct and
  short. The more you put in, the more you will get out of it.
- **Do more beyond your homework!** You'll find that as you stretch beyond the
  scope of the problems I've given you, that's where the real learning will
  happen. Try something new, break something, extend something, and then tell me
  about and share it with the class!
- **The classroom is your friend.** Imagine sitting in a room with a group of
  like-minded people with the same interests as you. Sounds great, right? Well,
  that's exactly what our classroom is! Please share ideas, thoughts, questions
  and more with the group. Nothing is worth feeling embarrassed.
- **Embrace discomfort.** I will introduce ideas you will never have heard of
  and it will all seem quite complicated at first. This is fine and intentional.
  I find that learning works best when you're thrown in the deep end, made to
  swim in the ocean as it were.

And lastly, I will repeat: **do not be afraid to ask questions**! Interrupt me,
please. You may have heard this several times before but I'll repeat it again:
if you've got a question, chances are someone has the same one too. Do us all a
favor and ask it!

## This website

This website is meant to be a digital companion for the course, it is not a
replacement. It is highly unlikely you will be able to complete the course
relying solely on this website if you are a beginner to digital design.

My explanations are not comprehensive, you should always refer to a textbook for
a full description of the topic. The information I give you is motivated by:

1. Helping you get to those "aha!" moments
2. Filling in the intuition gaps that textbooks miss
3. Relevance to our course and what we're trying to build

I've organized the topics and information on each page in accordance with the
above guidelines. The goal is that each heading topic motivates the next, in a
cascade effect.

A glossary of terms is included at the end of each session to help you in report
writing and to avoid any use of imprecise language.
