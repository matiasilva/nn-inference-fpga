# Session 1: Understanding chip design

Have you ever wondered what powers the millions of electronic devices around

with transistors, then gates, logic blocks and ending with entire chips, the
semiconductor industry is an amazing feat of humanity. Chips, or Application
Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), are hidden everywhere: in Huawei cell
towers, in Samsung RAM memory controllers, and Apple’s M-series chips. They are
so ubiquitous, they are nearly forgotten and overlooked.
