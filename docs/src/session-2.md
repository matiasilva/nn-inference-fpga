# Session 2: Digital logic primer

Now that we understand what we're building and roughly how we're going to do it,
let's dig into some of the fundamentals of digital design.

## Binary arithmetic

The binary counting system, or base 2, is much like the decimal counting system
we use everyday. As humans, we are no strangers to using a non-decimal counting
system. We count our minutes and hours in the sexagesimal counting system, a
notion which first originated with the ancient Sumerians. A counting system
simply determines how we represent a number, and it is this binary
representation that is particularly suitable for computer operations. That's all
there is to it!

The key ideas in binary arithmetic applicable to digital design are:

1. There are two states: 1 and 0
2. All numbers have an associated bit width. A 4-bit number holds 4 bits. The
   same is true in decimal but we often conveniently ignore this in basic
   arithmetic since this limitation is unimportant.
3. When a number overflows (eg. the result of 1111 + 1), we roll back to 0. You
   can think of this as truncated addition, see below.
4. 1 + 1 = 0 !

```txt
       2³  2²  2¹  2⁰
     ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
       1   1   1   1    (15)
    +  0   0   0   1    (+1)
     ├───┼───┼───┼───┤
   1 │ 0 │ 0 │ 0 │ 0 │  (0, overflow!)
     └─┬─┴───┴───┴───┘
       │
       └─ Overflow bit (truncated)

```

## Boolean functions

Boolean algebra is a close sister of binary counting, mainly because the 1 and 0
states map nicely onto true and false. True is commonly associated with 1 and
false with 0. In boolean algebra, we define a few fundamental operations:

1. AND: a.b
2. OR: a+b
3. XOR: a^b
4. NOT: !a

There are a few more, but these are just negations of the above, like NAND
!(a.b). I've been a bit careless with my syntax above, since I've tried to stick
to the mathematical notation used for those operations. In software and HDLs, we
use a slightly different mixture of symbols to represent the above.

For each operation, we can define a truth table. These enumerate the outputs for
all the possible inputs. You'll notice all operations save for NOT have 2
operands (inputs). Here's the truth table for AND as an example:

```txt
A | B | A AND B
--|---|--------
0 | 0 |   0
0 | 1 |   0
1 | 0 |   0
1 | 1 |   1
```

## Signed numbers

As computers started to proliferate, we needed a way to represent negative
numbers. Remember, all we've got is 1s and 0s, you can't just "add a -" to the
start of the number. Eventually, we standardized on a method called two's
complement. There are three ideas we need to apply 2's complement in our
circuits:

1. The most significant bit (ie. the leftmost bit) is the sign bit.
2. If the sign bit is set, we subtract the number associated with that power of
   two from the remaining bits.
3. To negate a number, we invert all the bits and add 1.

Let's take an example:

```txt
  2³  2²  2¹  2⁰
┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 0 │ 0 │ 1 │
└───┴───┴───┴───┘
```

Interpreting this as an unsigned binary number, we've got 9 (8 + 1). If we
interpret as signed, this becomes -8 + 1 = -7.

For negation, we have:

```txt
 2³  2²  2¹  2⁰
 0   1   1   1   Original: 7
 1   0   0   0   Inverted
 1   0   0   1   +1 = -7
```

## What is digital logic?

Digital logic is an abstraction built upon fundamental units called logic gates.
These gates are themselves made up of switching transistors arranged in special
patterns with resistors to achieve the respective binary functions. There is no
one strictly correct implementation of a gate, the "best" one will vary
according to the specific power, area and performance requirements of the
design. Here, we have a generic NOR and AND gate implementation:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="and-or-gates.png"></p>

The notion of digital is itself part of this transistor-level abstraction.
Digital implies binary: 0 or 1, HIGH or LOW, 0V or 5V. However, MOSFETs or
BJTs[^note] can take any allowed voltage within their rated values, which is
inherently analog. So, to recap: gates are digital logic components themselves
made of "analog" transistors. Of course, the transistors inside gates are chosen
for properties that make them particularly suitable for gates, like their
voltage transfer characteristics.

Digital logic won over analog logic for various reasons that mostly stem from
the fact that having only two allowed states makes circuits easier to design and
understand, and therefore lets us turn up the level of complexity of our
circuits.

All logic gates implement one boolean function. These are circuits, after all,
so it's useful to have symbols for them:

You might imagine a simple logic function like `(A AND B) OR NOT C` can be
represented as such:

## Combinational logic

Combinational logic is formed from boolean functions whose outputs are fully
determined by their current inputs. You can achieve quite complex operations
using just combinational logic and clever tricks to manipulate bits. These
operations execute in zero time, ie. in under 1 clock cycle.

At the lowest level, combinational circuits are built from simple primitives
such as NAND gates (in ASIC designs) or LUTs (in FPGA designs). We'll get to
these later; for now, you just need an awareness that how your logic functions
are implemented will vary depending on the platform (ASIC or FPGA).

## Sequential logic

So far, we've seen that we can evaluate arbitrary boolean functions using logic
gates. However, any meaningful and useful computing system needs a bit more, in
particular it needs to store previous values so it can use them in future
computations.

The notion of 'previous' and 'current' require a concept of time. This is called
synchronous logic. We say that our circuit is _synchronous to_ a clock, ie. it
responds to the clock, most commonly a rising edge (positive edge). A clock
signal is a simple square wave with a 50% duty cycle. It is on for 50% of the
period and off for the other half.

Tying this all together, we arrive at sequential logic circuits, where the
outputs are a function of their current and previous inputs. Flip-flops, also
called registers, are used to accomplish this. The simplest flop is a D-flip
flop, as shown.

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="max-width: 40%" src="dflop.png"></p>

The component above has 3 inputs: clock, `d` and reset. It has one output `q`. A
D-flip flop holds the value of the previous input for one clock cycle. D-flip
flops are so common that we simply refer to them as 'flops'.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Sometimes, you get an additional output which is the inverted version of `Q`,
> since it falls out naturally out of the transistor implementation of a D-flop.

## Waveforms

One way to visualize sequential logic circuits is with waveform diagrams, as
below.

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="s2-c2.svg"></p>

On the 2nd positive edge of the clock, the input to the flop goes high. The
output, however, remains unchanged. One clock cycle later, the flop's output
matches its previous input. Aha, we've got 1 cycle's worth of "memory"!.

This diagram exposes a key understanding of synchronous logic: launching and
sampling/capturing. We say that `d` is launched on the 2nd clock edge but only
sampled by the flop on the 3rd positive edge. This diagram makes that a bit
clearer by drawing the 0->1 transition of `d` slightly after the positive edge.
In reality, things are more complicated.
