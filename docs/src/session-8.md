# Session 8: Architecture and Datapath

In [Session 6](/docs/src/session-6.md) we saw how a convolutional network is
structured and the kinds of computation involved during training and inference.
In this session, we're going to breaking down the exact data operations required
to achieve one successful round of inference. This will allow us write our
specification for what we're going to build.
